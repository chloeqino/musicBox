About our app

For our app, we have two main features; a shuffle music player and a playable quiz quessing game. 

For the music player, we incorporated four hand gestures to be able to use it; pointing hand, open hand, closed hand,
and two open hands. We thought opening and closing hands would be suitable for pausing and resuming playback. We chose 
pointing hand to chose a random song. We also wanted to be able to switch between songs, so we used a pointing hand for 
that action. If the user liked the song, we added a feature where they can go to the tracks page that has more information
on it by using the two open hands gesture. 

For the quiz game, we incorporate three hand gestures to be able to use it; left hand open right hand closed, right hand open
left hand closed, and two closed hands. To pick on of the two options, you can chose the left option by using the left hand open
right hand closed gesture, and vice versa with the right option. We also implemented being able to quit the game by using
the two closed hands gesture.
